          <h1>Beer in Hampshire</h1>
          <p>I have now lived in Southampton for approximately three years, and have some small pieces of beer knowledge to pass on from that time.</p><br>
          <p>Firstly, <a href="http://www.bittervirtue.co.uk/">Bitter Virtues</a> is likley the best beer shop I have ever been to, and also likely one of the best in the country. They stock at least about 400 beers (not necessarily all at once), and in particular they have a very good Belgium selection. They also have some local beers that I am not aware of being sold anywhere by bottle. A full list of beers is on their website.</p><br>
          <p> I also live very close to the <a href="http://www.theguidedogsouthampton.co.uk/">Guide Dog</a>, who have won a number of Best Pub awards. They have seven regularly rotated ales (many of which are local), as well as ESB, on tap. They also have a good bottle selection. <a href="http://www.therockstone.co.uk/">The Rockstone</a> is another very good pub, serving 8 ales on tap, a good range of food (including vegan food), and a small beer garden. Lastly, the Great Western Arms has a similar sized selection, has won awards, and has a superb beer garden. It is also very accessible, being next to St. Deny's train station. I have been told that the Junction, just down the raod from Great Western, is very good, but I have not been there.</p>

         <h1>Home Brew Experiments</h1>
         <p>I have done a couple of home brews, only from scratch, but I thought that I may as well share what little I have learnt here. I will add stuff here when I have a chance to think about it.</p>
        </div>
        <div id="list">
          <h1>My Beer Tasting List</h1>
          <p>Below is a list of beers that I have had at least a pint and that I have remembered to note that what I thought so I could record it here. I will try to include pictures of the bottles if available. And feel free to vehemently disagree with me!</p>
