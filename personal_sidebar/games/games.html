        <h1>Go</h1>
        <p>Go is a two player board game, and according to Wikipedia is  one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Board_game#Timeline">oldest board games in existence</a>. The rules are very simple, but it is one of the most complex games in existence, as can be seen from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_complexity#Complexities_of_some_well-known_games">another Wikipedia link</a>.<p>
        <p>The rules are listed very concisely <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rules_of_Go#Concise_statement">here</a>, and slightly less concisely, but with useful pictures, <a href="http://www.britgo.org/intro/intro2.html">here</a>. In my opinion the best place to play online is <a href="http://www.gokgs.com/">KGS</a>, though there are servers where you can make a move a day or less. The classic resource for all things go related is <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/">Sensei's library</a>. Finally, there is a thriving online go community <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk">on Reddit</a>, which has <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/baduk/wiki/faq#wiki_resources">resources page</a> with links to everything else you could possibly want. 

        <h2>Learning Go</h2>
        <p>I often find it easier to learn if I feel like I am explaining what I am doing to other people. I also think that often when I read or watch videos about go that many things are assumed that I am not aware of. As a lowly 8 kyu (that is my current <a href=http://www.gokgs.com>KGS</a> rank, it is probably an overestimate) I intend to try and keep a biweekly (this will/should probably go down to weekly) blog style thing. In this I intend to go over joseki and tesuji that I think are cool, interesting or vital, and interesting fuseki or pro games that I am reviewing.</p>

        <p>At some point I will make an easier referencing system, and possibly add somewhere for people to comment. In the meantime, do <a href="../contact/contact.html">email</a> me if you have any questions or comments.</p>
        
        <h3>5K-5K game review</h3>
        <p>Here is another review taken from the go teaching ladder.</p>

        <h3>Joseki - part 1 (of many)</h3>
        <p>I recently bought Yoshio Ishida's Dictionary of Basic Joseki. I plan on going through this quite thoroughly (I currently am not very sure about the 3-4 point and hence tend to play 4-4 myself, and approach 3-4 very aggressively). This starts with the diagonal response of black to white's knight approach.</p>

        <h3>4kyu-3kyu gme review</h3>
        <p>I collected the following game from <a href="http://gtl.xmp.net/">the go teaching ladder</a>, where one can upload go games and get them reviewed by someone significantly stronger. I have left in the comments that were given, and made my own comments, which are obviously going to be much less accurate, but show my current understanding of the game.</p>

        <h3>Chinese 1 (low)</h3>
        <p>The Chinese fuseki (opening) is one of the most popular openings with all levels of players. It's name derives from the fact that Chinese players were the first to play the opening regularly.</p>
        <p>The general idea is that black builds up a huge moyo (framework) which invites white to invade. When she does, black attacks, and builds territory rapidly as he does. Anyway, below I go through some of the very basic ideas, approximately following the first chapter of The Chinese opening by Kato Masao.</p>

        <h3>Monkey Jump</h3>
        <p>I look at the monkey jump, which is a significant end game move. It is very sensitive to the precise position of the surrounding stones, but the idea is always the same - a three space extension along the bottom line which reduces the opponents territory by about 6 to 10. I have given a number of positions in which it can occur, and though this is far from exhaustive, it should give the main idea. Enjoy!</p>

        <h3>High 4-4 approach</h3>
        <p>Today I shall be considering basic responses to the high 4-4 approach; i.e. if you play on the 4-4 and someone approaches on the fourth line. There will not be much detail, but I think that the idea of why each response is good or bad is clear, and from there, though the precise moves may not the same, the spirit is quite easy to follow.</p>

        <h3>The ear-reddening game</h3>
        <p>Below is my review of the ear-reddening game. This is an old game and hence there will be many things that were normal then and I will not be aware of. Also, there are of course many deep moves that will go over my head, so the below is just my perspective.</p>

        <h3>The 3-3 point</h3>
        <p>Below is a review of the 3-3 invasion after when black already has a stone on the star point. I am following, approximately, the josekis from <a href="http://eidogo.com/">eidogo</a>.</p>
