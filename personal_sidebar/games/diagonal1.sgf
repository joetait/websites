C[I recently purchased Yoshio Ishida's Basic Dictionary of Joseki 1. I will be (slowly) documenting how I work through this.

;B[qd]C[The entire book covers various responses to this traditional initial move. 

Of course, in the course of a normal game the corners would be played before white would even consider responding. For the sake of this demo we will have white approach immediately.]
;W[oc]C[This is probably the most popular and felxible approach]
;B[pe]LB[jc:D][kc:C][lc:B][md:A][nd:1]C[This is the black response we will be considering currently.

This is aiming to attack the white stone at 1.

HOwever, it doesn't directly attack white, and white has the option of playing a,b,c or d in response. In fact, can just ignore and play elsewhere.]
(
;W[md]LB[kc:A]C[After this, black needs to solidify on the right hand side. He can attack at A first too]
(
;B[qj]C[This is a good size extension, after which white will need to shore up on the top]
;W[ic]C[Now that both side are solid, black needs to protect the corner, which is a large move, worth about 20 points if white can play it first]
;B[pc]LB[ob:A]C[This is the obvious block, which white needs to respond to.

If white ignores black can play at A]

(
;W[lc]LB[qj:B][ss:A]C[White can make a two space extension, which is certainly solid.

Black should now protet the corner first. See A for what happens if he tenukis, and afterwards check out B]
(
;B[pc]C[as withe knights move black ust secure the corner, but since white is 1) lower 2) more secure, this should be done before moving along the right]
;W[od]C[White extends, as with the knights move, in order to stop black invading.]
;B[pg]C[Black finishes the sequence by extending]
)
(
;B[ss];W[qb];B[qi]TR[qi]C[White's stones are niecely balanced, and it doesn't appear that black has any advantage in the corner, despite playing there first.

Despite this, if black plays at the marked stone straight away, going for the corner is not best. See B in the previous variation]

;W[ne]C[white plays here to stop black playing on top later, since she is low]

;W[ob]TR[ne]C[White extends, but due to the marked stone in a different direction]
