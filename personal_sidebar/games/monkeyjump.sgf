C[Today I will be looking at the monkey jump. This is a very large end \
game move. Often the first move or two will be made, and then it will \
be left till later in the game to fight over the last couple of points.

I have set up a number of situations in which this could occur. These \
are not comprehensive, but they will be similar to most examples \
(probably). However, the monkey jump is very flexible and subtle, so it\
 will depend a lot on context.]
(;B[ak]C[This is the standard monkey jump. It is connect to the marked \
stone, and can be connected in more than one way, according to sente \
and points

 hand side of the board]
